# Conq

A custom Risk game project in Python.

## Using the Code

* The Python apps Server and Client run from the command line
* From a Terminal, first run the Server app
* Then from additional Terminals, run one or more instances of the Client app
* If you hard stop the Server app (e.g. Ctrl-Z) then you will need to use the OS to Stop the Python Processes on the machine before restarting the Server app.  In Mac OSX that can be done from the Activity Monitor.

## Potential Epics and Features

* Foundational play - Board, Combat, and Turns
* Gameplay metrics
* Automated turn execution
* Probabilities and AI driven execution
